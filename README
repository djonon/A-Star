Description:
************
The algorithm searches a map to find the best possible path to reach its target.
To help chose the best possible path, the algorithm will use an equation that takes into 
account the distance from the tile to the target and the cost of moving to that tile

Inputs: large map file in a txt format (large_map.txt)


Known problems to the proposed solution:
****************************************

1.The first attempt at runing the program may not find the target. Please run the program 
a number of times until it finds the best route. This problem is due to the fact that,
adjacency generation and calculation in the program still needs some work

2. It may help to run the program on a small size map say 10x10 (by manually editing
UserMap map = new UserMap(50, 50); in the TraverseMap class to UserMap map = new UserMap(10, 10);
it still may not get to the target at first run, but the screen is less busy and allows for better view
